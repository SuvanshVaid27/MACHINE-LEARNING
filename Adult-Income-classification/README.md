# Adult-Income Classification

This project uses different personal attributes of a person to predict his/her income class. The dataset is taken from the UCI repository (Link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) and is quite a popular choice for classification use cases. 
The processing power of Spark and pipeline functionality of MLlib is leveraged in this project to create a decent classifier model in no time on a good sized data.
